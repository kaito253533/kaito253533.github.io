    This is the practice of R language from QUT tutorial materials. I made this to record my learning process. <br/>The data set represents the rent prices of different types of houses in the Brisbane area. As We can see, the data set contains the house types(column-dwelling_type), weely rent price(column-weekly_rent), and location(column-locality).<img src="img/project/P1_data.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"> 
    Firstly, we can use the 'summary' function to gain the basic idea of the data set. Now, the detail infomation has been shown, such as minimum, median, and mean.<img src="img/project/P1_process1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"> Then, try to use the 'aggregate' function to find out the 'mean' of each types of houses. <img src="img/project/P1_process2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"> Finally, use 'barplot' function to generate a bar chart.<img src="img/project/P1_process3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"> 
    The bar chart will look like <img src="img/project/P1_result1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"> Now, we can use ggplot2 library to draw another bar chart.<img src="img/project/P1_process4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"><img src="img/project/P1_result2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt">
    Moreover, we are going to find the weekly rent not only for each types of houses but also in different locations. As a result, we also use 'aggregate' function, but this time, we use multi feacture to do the 'group by'. Same, we can use 'bar chart' function to draw a chart.<img src="img/project/P1_process5.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"> <img src="img/project/P1_result3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"> And also can use ggplot function. <img src="img/project/P1_process6.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"> <img src="img/project/P1_result4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"> If you are interested this project, you can access the url which is placed below.
