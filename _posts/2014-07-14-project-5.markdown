description: 
 This is the the first project I have done.<br/> The title is 'Big Data Analytics Based on The Implementation of Apache Spark'.<br/> 
 <P>After I built a platform by Apache Spark, I tried to analyse data on it. The data is about the car accidents in the UK.</P>
 <h3>Descriptive Analyzing</h3>
 <P>Firstly, I just simply showed the amount in different conditions, such as weather, road type, and light condition</P>

 <h3>Clustering</h3>

 <P>To sum up, in the Raining day, people usually drive more carefully, however, there are still some accidents happened because roads are wet. In this cluster, the accidents are usually slight accidents with fewer vehicles and fewer casualties. Moreover, in cluster 1, in the snowing day, people drive carefully too, but the accidents still happened, and also the number of vehicles and casualties is lower than the next cluster. Finally, cluster 2 has fine weather, dried roads. However, the number of vehicles and the number of casualties are the highest due to people usually drive faster under these conditions.</P>
