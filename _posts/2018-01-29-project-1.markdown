    story: This is the practice of R language from QUT tutorial materials. I made this to record my learning process. We used the data set which represents the rent prices of different types of houses in the Brisbane area. <img src="img/project/P1_data.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt">
    process: Firstly, we used the 'summary' function to gain the basic idea of the data set.<img src="img/project/P1_process1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"> Then, try to use the 'aggregate' function to find out the 'mean' of each types of houses. <img src="img/project/P1_process2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"> Finally, use 'barplot' function to generate a bar chart.<img src="img/project/P1_process2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"> 
    result: <img src="img/project/P1_result.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt">
