    This is the practice of R language from QUT tutorial materials. I made this to record my learning process. <br/>The data set represents the rent prices of different types of houses in the Brisbane area. As We can see, the data set contains the house types(column-dwelling_type), weely rent price(column-weekly_rent), and location(column-locality).<img src="img/project/P1_data.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"> 
    Firstly, after we get the data, we need to clean it. So we use R to remove some unexpected value.<br/>Ensure there are no 0 values for latitude and longitude.<br/>Ensure the year value is not NA, is less than or equal to 2016 and larger than 1800<br/>Ensure that no mass values are NA.<img src="img/project/P2_process1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt">Moreover, we use some functions to get detailed data:<img src="img/project/P2_process2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"><img src="img/project/P2_process3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt">Now, if we want to show the data on the google map, we need to call the service through google api.<img src="img/project/P2_process4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"><img src="img/project/P2_process5.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt">Finally, for better representation, we use different colours to show different range of rent price.<img src="img/project/P2_result1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt"> If you are interested this project, you can access the url which is placed below.
